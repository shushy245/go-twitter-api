Welcome to my project!
To start, change the personal configuration details in the .env file to fit your own account
Automigration is on, so beware if you have existing tables called "tweets" or "users"
You can turn it off if you want, just look up db.AutoMigrate and comment the line
Make sure to run "go get" with all necessary packages

TODO: Put query validation in middleware, separate duplicate code into more helper functions, use goroutines for stuff such as tweet upload, more validations, find way to avoid using ANY type conversion while looking up user Ids, handle value restrictions on DB level, separate into more files - a struct folder, a routes folder etc.
